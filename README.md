# Trailblazer-App-Salesforce-Quick-Start
This project documents my completion of the **"Quick Start: Build a Salesforce App"** module on Trailhead, where I built the **Trailblazer App** using **clicks, not code**. The goal was to create a simple Salesforce application that tracks places I want to visit using a custom object called `Waypoint__c`.
